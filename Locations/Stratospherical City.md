**A city built in the sky, built to protect its citizens and the people who live below the surface.**

Stratospherical City, the one place that provides safety from the outside world.

It stands as a symbol of Strato, this universe's god of the Clouds.
It's leaded by *someone*, who founded the city after the world became to dangerous to live in.
